# 🧬 Bio File Format Explorer

This project reads and analyzes basic biological file formats:

- **FASTA files** for DNA & protein sequences  
- **PDB files** for 3D protein or DNA structures  

We use:
- ✅ BioPython to parse FASTA & PDB
- ✅ Matplotlib to plot base/amino acid composition
- ✅ Py3Dmol to visualize 3D structures in Colab
